- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ignotus-mago, also known as the artist Paul Hertz.
- 👀 I’m interested in intermedia, algorithmic art.
- 🌱 My current programming interests involve writing audio data as pixel values to a space-filling curve. I hope to begin work with half edge data structures, too. 
- 💞️ I’m currently collaborating with a composer to produce work for a large scale architectural video wall.
- 📫 How to reach me: check out information on my website, https://paulhertz.net/.
